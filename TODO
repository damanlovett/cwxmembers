Cary Updates:
  ☐ Make player drop down have only players that signed up of the show
      The assignment list doesn't match the players who signed up for the show (in this example there are 8 people signed up and 13 users in the list)
  ☐ Make assinments unique
      You are able to assign someone to multiple show roles (may be done accidentally).
  ☐ Remove the extra toggle
        Just list it as "Ref/Host Needed" and "Voice/DJ" needed.
  ☐ Add Mettlesome and Alumnit to the show dropdown
  ☐ Take off date time from the edit show form
